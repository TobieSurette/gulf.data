name	keywords	definitionsGSL	geography	Abbreviation for the Southern Gulf of Saint-Lawrence.ecdysis	growth	Formal name for the process of moulting during crustacean growth. terminal moult	growth	"Final moult after which no further growth occurs. In snow crab, is accompanied by sexual maturation and characteristic changes in secondary sexual characters: chela shape in males and abdomen size in females."Morphometric maturity	sexual maturity	Sexual maturity determined from measured or observed changes in secondary sexual characters acquired during the terminal moult of snow crab.Legal-sized           	fishery	Male snow crab with carapace width 95mm or greater.Commercial crab	fishery	Legal-sized and morphometrically mature male crab.Chela(e)	biology	Front pair of crab pereopods (legs) that are equipped with pincers.Carapace hardness	fishery	"Degree of hardness of a crab carapace, usually measured using a specially designed durometer to male crab chela."Durometer	fishery; biology	"Device used to measure crab carapace hardness. Values range from 0 to 100. For most of the sGSL, 68 represents the threshold for soft/hard-shelled crab, while a value of 78 is used in the Area 19 fishery."Carapace condition	biology	Categorical scale used to rank the relative age of snow crab carapaces since the last moult.New-shelled crab	growth; biology	Crab that moulted in winter-early spring of the current year.White crab	growth; biology	New-shelled with shell hardness less than 78.Intermediate-crab	growth; biology	Crab that have moulted in previous years.Old-shelled	growth; biology	Crab with heavy accumulation of epibionts and heavy carapace ageing and even deterioration.Fishery recruitment	fishery	"New-shelled, commercial male crab. "Fishery residuals	fishery	"Intermediate or old-shelled, commercial male crab, representing the exploitable portion of the commercial stock which remains after the fishery."
